     <p>Marina Bay Sands is an integrated resort in Singapore that is owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which is based in Paradise, Nevada in the United States.
     Marina Bay Sands is located right alongside Marina Bay and right across the Downtown Centre area of Singapore.
     The area surrounding Marina Bay has a mixed-use including commercial, residential, hotel, and entertainment.
     Apart from Marina Bay Sands, another interesting landmark in the Marina Bay area is the Waterfront Promenade and shopping mall. This cost the Singaporean Government about $35 million to create.
     <br><br> The towers of Marina Bay Sands have a peculiar shape. They are wide on ground levels, narrow down as they go up only to become wider again on top floors. This gives the impression that there are two towers are leaning against each other.
     The resort has been designed by Moshe Safdie, an Israeli-Canadian architect who is said to have been inspired by a deck of cards when constructing the building.
     Maybe he spent a bit too much time on the blackjack tables before making his decision? who knows…
     The Art Facts team did some more research on Safdie, and one of his other creations is “Raffles City” towers in Chongqing, China. You can clearly see the resemblance with Marina Bay Sands.<br><br>
